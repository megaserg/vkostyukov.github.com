This is my first post on this blog. Needless to say, I'm really excited about this. This is my first attempt in writing blog posts in English. I was previously posting in Russian at [LJ](http://vkostyukov.livejournal.com) and [Tumbler](http://vkostyukov.tumblr.com), but it wasn't about technical things. Here, I will try to post only about CS. I have huge plans on posting about Scala and it's application for research of purely functional data structures. I should probably post about algorithms and data structures that I've already implemented in [Scalacaster](https://github.com/vkostyukov/scalacaster). There are loads of awesome pieces of Scala code that I want to tell about. One of my favorites - [QuickSelect](https://github.com/vkostyukov/scalacaster/blob/master/src/search/SelectionSearch.scala) in a purely functional setting.

Anyway, I'm really looking forward to writing here. And I'm currently in the middle of writing my first useful post here. I'm going to describe a new and purely functional implementation technique of [Union-Find](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint-set_data_structure) data structure. I've almost committed the implementation, but it's still requires a bit of improvement.
